The Restored Monochrome Versions of the Gen III core series games, Ruby and Sapphire

Those of you who are Trekkies may remember that there was a Star Trek fan community project involving the restoration of William Shakespeare's play "Hamlet" to the original Klingon; the result was dubbed the Restored Klingon Version.
The same principle more or less applies to this restoration of Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire to their "original" Gen I incarnations.
Materials from the original Gen I games are welcome, as are materials in the style thereof.
Basically, the goal here is to make playable Gen I versions of the Gen III games, as faithful to the Gen III versions as the limitations at the time of Gen I allow.
